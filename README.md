# PowderTS
Falling sand game in typescript. For fun :)


## Building the game
1. Clone the repo (`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jenna8x4/PowderTS.git`)
2. Open a terminal
3. Enter the repo folder
4. Run `npm install webpack`
5. Go to the `Canvas-Engine` folder
6. Run `npm install`
7. Run `npm run build` (this should execute the `build.bat` but only works on windows)
8. The game should be now in a new folder called `dist`

## Try it out!
Access the game from your browser right [here](https://jenna8x4.github.io/PowderTS/dist/)
